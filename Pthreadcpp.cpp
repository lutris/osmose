 * Description : This class is the most basic pthread C++ encapsulation.
 * It's used to handle JOINABLE / UNDETACHED posix threads.
 * To create a thread, simply inherit this class, and override the run()
 * method, and call the start method with input argument if any. Finally
 * call Join(...) to wait the Thread if needed.
