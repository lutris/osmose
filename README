       Version 0.9.96 - public release, written by Bruno Vedder.


Osmose means:
-------------

Object      Oriented
       S.m.s.         Emulator.

In brief it's an Sega Master System / Game Gear emulator encapsulated into C++
classes :-)


What's new:
-----------

Osmose now owns a clean graphical user interface based on Qt. Qt was the first
GUI lib powerful enough to refresh display at 60 Hz. So SDL is no longer used now.

- Switch sound system to use ALSA.
- GUI development using Qt.
- Rendering / Key mapping adapted to QtOpenGL.
- Configuration system rewritten.


Dependencies:
-------------
- Qt 5.x or >= 4.6
- Alsa

Development headers for these libraries are needed to compile from the source.

For Ubuntu/Debian (Qt5):
    sudo apt-get install qt5-qmake qtbase5-dev libqt5opengl5-dev libasound2-dev

For Fedora (Qt5):
    sudo yum install qt5-qtbase-devel alsa-lib-devel


Compilation:
------------

To build osmose, do from the source directory:
    qmake
    make

To build with the system's minizip library instead of the bundled unzip code,
configure the build with:
    qmake CONFIG+=system-minizip


Vertical synchronisation:
-------------------------

Osmose uses double buffering to avoid tearing image on the screen, but this does
not guarantee that the rendering will be synchronized with the screen rendering.

Keep in mind that Osmose uses OpenGL for rendering and filtering.

Synchronisation is a matter of choice: High frames per second or Synchronisation.
On my Ubuntu, the closed source driver provide an option in the tab performance:
"Sync to VBlank". When selected the rendering is stable, without flickering. The
CPU usage is a bit higher. Without this option, the Osmose rendering is sometime
teared but uses lower CPU. I suppose that this option is available on all the
drivers. Make your choice!


Sound:
------

Osmose uses ALSA for the sound system. It has been reported that concurrent
application using the sound channel can inhibit osmose sound rendering. So,
avoid watching videos while playing with Osmose!


Features:
--------

- SMS: Good compatibility. At this stage, the emulator can run* 96% of commercial
  games and public demos, except games that relies on codemaster mapper, which
  works but does not have proper video mode emulation.
- Game Gear: Good compatibility. At this stage, the emulator can run 98.0%* of
  Game Gear ROMs.
- SN76489 Sound is supported.
- Support for .zip, .sms and .gg format.
- Video filters: bilinear or nearest neighbour (default).
- Pad (keyboard or joystick mapped) emulation.
- PAL/NTSC Timing.
- Japanese/Export console.
- In-game screenshots, GFX rip, sound shot.
- Customisable keyboard configuration.
- Joystick support, congigurable button assignement.
- Drag and drop your ROMs into the emulator window to run games.

* Due to the huge number of Game Gear/SMS ROMs (around 1300), games have not been
deeply tested.
