 *
 * Description: This class provide basic EmulationThread feature. It can start
 * pause, resume the rendering code that is provided in emulateOneFrame() pure
 * virtual method. The setRefreshingPeriod() set the number of frame per second
 * that is wanted. emulatOneframe() is called accordingly. The setResolution()
 * method emits a newResolution() signal to the QGLimage object to inform it
 * of a resolution change (e.g. emulated video mode switch). The texture buffer
 * videoBuffer is allocated accordingly.
 * This class MUST be inherited, and the derived class MUST provide the
 * emulateOneFrame() function, which perform emulation task and fill the video
 * buffer.
